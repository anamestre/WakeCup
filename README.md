Our project works with two devices, the Oura ring and the Muki cup. You first have to sleep with the ring on your finger, the ring will get every single information about your sleep activity, rest and readiness for the next day. Once you wake up, prepare yourself a coffee and serve it on the Muki cup, the hot coffee will charge the device and show the results of last night's activity. In consequence, it'll tell you how much coffee you need to take.
